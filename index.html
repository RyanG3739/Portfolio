    <h1>Ryan Green</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Passions and Goals: <br> I grew up in Muskego, WI where I always had a passion for sports. I enjoyed playing sports and games with friends, going to concerts, and learning new things along the way. As I grew older I found the one I loved the most, hockey, and continued playing it here in Eau Claire throughout my four years.</p>

    <p>Acheivements: <br> Some of my proudest moments have come through sports teams. I won the central division championship and the Robertson Cup runner-up in 2018 while I was playing junior hockey. When I came here to Eau Claire we won the WIAC Men's Championship and I have personally been recongnized as a member on the WIAC second team. In the classroom I have been recognized as the tutor coordinator for the Leadership and Technology club that I have been apart of for three years now.</p>
